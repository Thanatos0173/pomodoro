# Pomodoro
Simple pomodoro with a 7-segments display and 14-segments displays.

On the upper display : "Work" : Is time to work! "Rest" : You can take a break !

The texts "Pause", "Resume", "Start", "Stop" are of course clickable !

On the right-botton corner, a slider is here to change the volume.
